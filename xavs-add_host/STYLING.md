# XAVS Add Host Module - Styling Integration

## Overview

This module has been updated to use styling based on the `xavs-globals` module for consistency across the XAVS ecosystem.

## Changes Made

### CSS Structure
- **Updated existing CSS files**: Enhanced `theme.css`, `layout.css`, and `components.css` with xavs-globals styling
- **XAVS Brand Consistency**: Applied the same color scheme and typography from `xavs-globals`
- **Improved Accessibility**: Enhanced focus states and ARIA compliance
- **Light/Dark Theme Support**: Added automatic theme switching based on Cockpit preferences

### Key Design Elements

#### Color Scheme
- **Brand Color**: `#197560` (XAVS teal)
- **Support for Light/Dark Themes**: Automatic theme switching based on Cockpit preferences
- **Consistent Surface Colors**: Unified card backgrounds and borders

#### Typography
- **Font Family**: Tenorite with system fallbacks
- **Improved Readability**: Better line heights and letter spacing
- **Consistent Sizing**: Standardized font sizes across components

#### Components
- **Buttons**: Unified button styles with hover effects and focus states
- **Form Controls**: Consistent input styling with brand-colored focus
- **Tables**: Enhanced table appearance with hover states
- **Cards**: Improved card layout with subtle shadows
- **Tabs**: Brand-consistent tab styling

### File Structure

```
xavs-add_host/
├── css/
│   ├── theme.css           # Updated with xavs-globals color scheme
│   ├── layout.css          # Enhanced layout with improved spacing
│   └── components.css      # Modernized components with xavs styling
├── index.html              # Uses existing CSS structure
└── js/                     # JavaScript files (unchanged)
```

### HTML Changes
- No changes required to HTML structure - maintains existing CSS file references
- All existing HTML structure and classes remain compatible

### Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Matches the visual design of other XAVS modules
2. **Maintainability**: Familiar CSS structure is preserved
3. **Performance**: No additional HTTP requests
4. **Accessibility**: Improved focus states and keyboard navigation
5. **Responsive**: Better mobile and tablet experience
6. **Theme Support**: Automatic light/dark theme adaptation

### Theme Support
The module automatically adapts to Cockpit's theme settings:
- **Light Theme**: Clean, professional appearance with good contrast
- **Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes with appropriate dark surfaces

### Future Considerations
- Consider extracting common XAVS styles to a shared CSS library
- Monitor for updates to the base `xavs-globals` styling
- Ensure consistency when adding new UI components

## Usage

The module will automatically use the new styling when loaded. No additional configuration is required.

## Compatibility

This update maintains full backward compatibility with existing JavaScript functionality while providing an enhanced visual experience.
