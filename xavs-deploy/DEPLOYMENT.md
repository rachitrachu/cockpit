## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Server Requirements
- Cockpit web console (9090) installed and running
- Kolla-Ansible environment configured
- Inventory file available at `/root/xdeploy/nodes`
- Python virtual environment at `/opt/xenv/`
- Sufficient disk space for deployment logs

### 2. Installation Steps
```bash
# 1. Copy module to Cockpit directory
sudo cp -r xavs-deploy /usr/share/cockpit/

# 2. Set proper permissions  
sudo chown -R root:root /usr/share/cockpit/xavs-deploy
sudo chmod 644 /usr/share/cockpit/xavs-deploy/*
sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/cockpit/xavs-deploy

# 3. Restart Cockpit (if needed)
sudo systemctl restart cockpit
```

### 3. Access & Testing
```
URL: https://your-server:9090/xavs-deploy
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] UI loads correctly without errors
- [ ] Inventory hosts are detected and displayed  
- [ ] All 35+ commands are available in dropdown
- [ ] Service selection grid displays properly
- [ ] Host targeting functions work
- [ ] Dry run mode (--check) executes successfully
- [ ] Progress tracking displays real-time updates
- [ ] Danger warnings appear for destructive commands
- [ ] Raw output scrolling functions properly
- [ ] Task progress minimize/expand works

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Ensure Cockpit authentication is properly configured
- Limit access to authorized deployment personnel only
- Use strong passwords and consider certificate-based auth
- Monitor access logs regularly

### Command Execution
- All commands run with appropriate sudo/superuser privileges
- Virtual environment isolation maintained
- Inventory file access properly restricted
- Command parameters validated before execution

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor memory usage during long deployments
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify WebSocket connections remain stable
- Track deployment completion times

### Log Management
- Deployment logs stored in standard Ansible locations
- Raw output captured in browser for immediate review
- Consider log rotation for long-term storage
- Archive successful deployment logs for reference

### Updates & Maintenance
- Keep Cockpit updated to latest stable version
- Monitor Kolla-Ansible releases for compatibility
- Update service tags when new services are added
- Review and update SOP integration as needed

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "No hosts found in inventory"
**Solution**: Verify inventory file path and format, check permissions

**Issue**: Commands fail with permission errors  
**Solution**: Ensure proper sudo configuration and virtual environment access

**Issue**: UI doesn't load properly
**Solution**: Check Cockpit service status, browser compatibility, clear cache

**Issue**: Progress tracking not updating
**Solution**: Verify WebSocket connections, check console for errors
