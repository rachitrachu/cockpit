# VLAN Edit IP Address Detection Fix

## Issue Description
When editing a VLAN, all IP addresses were being removed from the interface. The logs showed:
- VLAN had `22.22.22.11/24` and `11.11.11.11/24` initially
- During edit, the system detected no IP addresses
- Configuration was set to DHCP instead of static
- Empty IP address fields were created

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **IP Address Parsing Issue**: The `getVlanDetailsFromSystem` function wasn't properly parsing IP addresses from `ip a` output
2. **Logic Flaw**: The IP configuration determination relied solely on refreshed data, ignoring original VLAN data
3. **Insufficient Debugging**: Not enough logging to understand why IP addresses weren't being detected

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced IP Address Parsing
- **Improved IP Regex**: Better parsing of `inet` lines from `ip a` output
- **CIDR Notation**: Automatic addition of `/24` if CIDR not present
- **IPv6 Support**: Added parsing for IPv6 addresses (excluding link-local)
- **Enhanced Logging**: More detailed logs showing interface blocks and IP detection

### 2. Robust IP Configuration Detection
```javascript
// Before: Only checked refreshed ipAddresses array
const hasStaticIps = vlan.ipAddresses && vlan.ipAddresses.length > 0;

// After: Check multiple sources for IP addresses
let allIpAddresses = [];
if (vlan.ipAddresses && Array.isArray(vlan.ipAddresses) && vlan.ipAddresses.length > 0) {
    allIpAddresses = vlan.ipAddresses;
} else if (vlan.ip && vlan.ip !== 'Not configured' && vlan.ip !== 'DHCP') {
    // Fallback to original IP field
    allIpAddresses = vlan.ip.includes(',') ? vlan.ip.split(',').map(ip => ip.trim()) : [vlan.ip];
}
```

### 3. Improved Debug Logging
- **Interface Block Detection**: Log when interface blocks are found/exited
- **IP Output Filtering**: Show relevant `ip a` output for the specific interface
- **Fresh Details Logging**: Log the complete fresh details object
- **Multi-source IP Detection**: Log all IP addresses found from different sources

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Graceful Fallback**: If fresh IP detection fails, use original VLAN data
- **Better Validation**: Check for empty strings and invalid IP values
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log both success and failure cases

## Key Changes Made

### `getVlanDetailsFromSystem` Function:
- Added interface block detection logging
- Improved IP address regex pattern
- Added automatic CIDR notation
- Enhanced error handling

### `editVlan` Function:
- Added debug logging for IP output sections
- Implemented multi-source IP address detection
- Enhanced IP configuration type determination
- Improved IP address population logic

### Debug Enhancements:
- More comprehensive logging throughout the process
- Better error messages and warnings
- Detailed debug output for troubleshooting

## Expected Results
After these fixes:
✅ **IP addresses should be properly detected** from system output
✅ **Edit form should populate with existing IPs** (22.22.22.11/24, 11.11.11.11/24)
✅ **Configuration type should be 'static'** when IPs are present
✅ **Fallback mechanisms** if system detection fails
✅ **Better debugging information** for future troubleshooting

## Testing
Test the VLAN edit function again and check the logs for:
1. Interface block detection messages
2. IP address parsing results
3. Configuration type determination
4. IP addresses populated in edit form

## Files Modified
- `vlan-manager.js`: Enhanced IP parsing, detection logic, and debugging
