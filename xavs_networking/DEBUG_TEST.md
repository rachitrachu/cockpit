# Interface Classification Debug Test

## Testing the fixed interface classification system

The fixes applied:

1. **Fixed JSON parsing**: Now properly handles colons in JSON configuration by splitting only on the first two colons
2. **Enhanced debugging**: Added console logging to see what's happening during detection
3. **Fallback detection**: If no system netplan files are found, check for system interfaces that exist but aren't managed by Cockpit
4. **Better error handling**: More specific error messages for debugging

## Expected Results

After the fix, you should see:
- No more "Failed to parse interface config" errors
- Proper detection of system-managed interfaces (like eno1.1117, eno1.1122)
- Clear console output showing which interfaces are detected as system vs. Cockpit managed

## How to Test

1. Refresh the networking page
2. Check the browser console for:
   - "System interface detection command output:" - shows what files were found
   - "Found system interfaces:" - shows interfaces detected from the system
   - "System-managed interfaces found:" - final list of system interfaces
3. Look for the "SYS" badge on interfaces that are system-managed

The system should now properly classify:
- **System interfaces**: eno1, eno2, eno3, eno4, enp131s0f0, enp131s0f1, eno1.1117, eno1.1122
- **Cockpit interfaces**: eno4, eno4.1199 (from 99-cockpit.yaml)

These system interfaces should appear with gray styling and the "SYS" badge.
