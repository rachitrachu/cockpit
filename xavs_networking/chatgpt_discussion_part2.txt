Perfect, Xloud. Acknowledging your hard guardrails:

We must not modify 00-installer-config.yaml.

All changes must be persistent.

Baseline‚Äëowned NICs are not read‚Äëonly in the UI (per your ‚Äúno‚Äù) ‚Äî but any edits must be done safely via overlays without touching baseline content.

Preempting default routes by metric is allowed.

Auto‚Äëdiscover ‚Äúspare NICs‚Äù is required.

Below is a drop‚Äëin, Copilot‚Äëready spec that updates our architecture to support baseline overlays (safe, scalar‚Äëonly overrides and additive lists) while keeping a single managed file. I‚Äôve included ergonomic stubs so Copilot can scaffold your JS quickly in the XAVS‚ÄëRachit_NEW branch.

üîë Executive Summary (what changes now)

File strategy: Keep baseline read‚Äëonly; write a single managed file /etc/netplan/90-xavs.yaml for everything we control.

Overlay mode for baseline NICs: Permit changes that override scalars (e.g., mtu, optional, dhcp4-overrides.route-metric, dhcp4-overrides.use-dns/use-routes) and append to lists (e.g., additional static routes). Do not try to ‚Äúreplace‚Äù list‚Äëtype keys (addresses, nameservers, routes) on baseline NICs ‚Äî Netplan merges lists from multiple files. 
Ubuntu People

Preferred defaults: Renderer networkd. Use netplan try for safe rollout with the standard 120s rollback window before finalize. 
Netplan
Ubuntu Manpages

Inventory posture: Auto‚Äëdiscover and badge Spare NICs (not referenced in baseline YAML and with no non‚ÄëLL addresses) so the operator can instantly build bonds/bridges without baseline edits.

VLANs are first‚Äëclass on top of any NIC (including baseline NICs) ‚Äî IP/route live on the VLAN, not the parent. 
Ubuntu People

Default‚Äëroute preemption: Allowed via route metrics or dhcp4-overrides.route-metric to out‚Äërank baseline DHCP defaults (typically metric 100). 
Ubuntu People

Phase‚Äë2 runway: Advanced PBR with routing-policy (and systemd [RoutingPolicyRule]) stays in backlog with hooks already modeled. 
Ubuntu People
Ubuntu Manpages

1) Netplan Multi‚Äëfile Rules we must design around

Netplan loads all /{lib,etc,run}/netplan/*.yaml; later files (by filename across all dirs) override scalars/amend mappings, and append to lists. /run > /etc > /lib in directory precedence. We will only write /etc. 
Ubuntu People

Consequence: you cannot ‚Äúclear‚Äù an addresses: or nameservers: list from baseline by adding another file; you only append. That‚Äôs why we do overlay‚Äësafe edits only on baseline NICs.

2) File Architecture (minimal, persistent)

Managed file: /etc/netplan/90-xavs.yaml (atomic write: *.new ‚Üí fsync ‚Üí rename).

Content: A single YAML doc with network: { version: 2, renderer: networkd }, then our ethernets, vlans, bonds, bridges.

Ownership model:

baseline: any interface defined in baseline YAML (read only for list‚Äëreplacing changes).

xavs: any interface we create or any overlay we apply to baseline NICs (overlay keys only).

This is fully aligned with Netplan‚Äôs merge semantics & precedence model. 
Ubuntu People

3) What we allow on baseline NICs (Overlay Matrix)

‚úÖ Allowed (scalar overrides / additive lists)

mtu, optional, wakeonlan, accept-ra, other scalar booleans/ints.

dhcp4-overrides / dhcp6-overrides (e.g., route-metric, use-dns, use-routes, send-hostname) ‚Äî these are the sanctioned levers to steer DHCP behaviour while staying persistent. 
Ubuntu People

Add static routes under the interface (routes: entries get appended).

For DNS with DHCP: set dhcp4-overrides.use-dns: false (scalar) then specify nameservers.addresses/search in our file to inject custom DNS without baseline‚Äôs DHCP clobbering them. 
Ubuntu People

‚õî Not allowed (would require baseline change)

Replacing/removing addresses, routes, nameservers previously set in baseline.

Converting a baseline NIC to a bridge/bond (because the IP must move off the physical into the bridge/bond ‚Äî that needs a baseline edit).

UX handling: The UI lets users select a baseline NIC and edits only the whitelisted fields; for disallowed ops we show a guided prompt explaining why (Netplan list‚Äëmerge behaviour) and offer alternative patterns (e.g., put the IP on a new VLAN; or use a Spare NIC for bonds/bridges). 
Ubuntu People

4) Supported interface types (Phase 1)

VLANs (on any NIC incl. baseline): vlans:<name> { id, link, addresses|dhcp, nameservers?, routes? }. IP/route live on VLAN; parent stays untouched by us. 
Ubuntu People

Bridges (on Spare NICs or XAVS VLANs/Bonds): Assign IP to bridge, members have no L3 in our file. 
Ubuntu People

Bonds (on Spare NICs): Assign IP to bond, members have no L3 and often optional: true. Support active-backup, 802.3ad first. 
Ubuntu People

Static routes: Per‚Äëinterface routes: with metric to prioritize; default DHCP routes are ~metric 100 ‚Äî lower wins. Also support dhcp4-overrides.route-metric for DHCP links. 
Ubuntu People

5) Default‚ÄëRoute Preemption (green‚Äëlit by you)

Two design patterns:

Static default on an XAVS interface with metric: <50> to outrank baseline‚Äôs 100.

DHCP default preemption: set dhcp4-overrides.route-metric: <lower> on the preferred DHCP interface. Both are documented patterns. 
Ubuntu People

6) Inventory, Ownership & ‚ÄúSpare NICs‚Äù

Discover runtime: ip -json link, ip -json addr, ip -json route, bridge -json link.

Parse YAML: load all /etc/netplan/*.yaml ‚Üí build per‚Äëfile and merged views + ownership map (baseline vs xavs).

Spare NIC = interface that:

is not present in baseline YAML,

has no non‚Äëlink‚Äëlocal addresses,

is not a member of any bond/bridge.

Badge in UI: ‚ÄúAvailable for Bond/Bridge‚Äù.

This empowers one‚Äëclick provisioning of bonds/bridges without baseline modifications.

7) Writer Rules (deterministic YAML)

Emit only XAVS‚Äëowned interfaces and overlays into 90-xavs.yaml.

Overlay for baseline NICs includes only whitelisted keys (see ¬ß3).

VLANs carry L3; bond/bridge carry L3; members have dhcp4: no under our control only when the member is XAVS‚Äëowned (never re‚Äëdeclare baseline members). Netplan examples show the canonical placement. 
Ubuntu People

Skeleton:

# /etc/netplan/90-xavs.yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd

  ethernets: {}
  vlans: {}
  bonds: {}
  bridges: {}

  # Example overlay on baseline NIC eno1 (safe-only):
  ethernets:
    eno1:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp4-overrides:
        route-metric: 80      # prefer this DHCP over baseline metric~100
        use-dns: false        # allow static DNS below to win
      nameservers:
        addresses: [1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8]
        search: [corp.local]

  # Example VLAN on baseline NIC eno1:
  vlans:
    eno1.15:
      id: 15
      link: eno1
      addresses: [10.15.0.10/24]
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 10.15.0.1
          metric: 50  # preempt baseline default


(Overlay levers and VLAN pattern mirror Netplan docs.)

8) Safe Apply Orchestration

Write 90-xavs.yaml.new ‚Üí sync ‚Üí rename to 90-xavs.yaml.

netplan generate --debug (validate YAML/schema).

netplan try --timeout 120 with visible countdown in UI (critical if the mgmt path is impacted).

On confirm: finalize. (Per docs, a confirmed try already cements the config; an explicit apply is harmless.) 
Ubuntu Manpages
Ask Ubuntu

netplan try defaults to 120s before rollback; ideal for remote Cockpit sessions. 
Netplan

9) CRUD Workflows (with baseline overlays)

Ethernet (baseline): Edit only overlay‚Äësafe fields; add routes; preempt default by metric.

Ethernet (xavs): Full CRUD (DHCP/static, DNS, routes).

VLAN: Full CRUD on any parent; IP/route on VLAN.

Bond/Bridge: Only on Spare NICs (or on XAVS VLANs/bonds as members). IP/route on the bond/bridge; members have no L3 in our file.

Delete: Remove stanza from YAML; netplan try. For immediate runtime cleanup of virtuals (VLAN/bridge/bond), ip link del <iface> post‚Äëapply.

10) UI/UX Contract (Cockpit)

Cards: Group by Ethernets / VLANs / Bonds / Bridges. Badge baseline vs xavs vs spare.

Modals:

Ethernet (baseline) ‚Üí ‚ÄúOverlay Mode‚Äù form (mtu, optional, dhcp overrides, nameservers, add routes, route-metric).

Ethernet (xavs) ‚Üí full form.

VLAN/Bridge/Bond ‚Üí canonical forms per docs with validation.

Critical banner: If target interface is on the default route or is the tty for the user‚Äôs session IP, enforce try path and show 120‚Äësecond countdown.

Diff preview: Display YAML diff of 90-xavs.yaml pre‚Äëapply.

Error surfacing: Show netplan generate --debug and try failures inline.

11) JS Stubs (so Copilot autocompletes the rest)

js/run.js

export function run(cmd, opts = {}) {
  return cockpit.spawn(["bash","-lc", cmd], { superuser: "try", ...opts })
    .then(out => String(out))
    .catch(e => { throw new Error(e.message || String(e)); });
}


js/discover.js

import { run } from "./run.js";
import { parseYamlFiles } from "./yaml-read.js"; // Copilot to scaffold

export async function discover() {
  const [links, addrs, routes] = await Promise.all([
    run("ip -json link"), run("ip -json addr"), run("ip -json route")
  ]);
  const files = await run("ls -1 /etc/netplan/*.yaml || true");
  const yamlInfo = await parseYamlFiles(files.split("\n").filter(Boolean));
  // Build ownership map:
  // baseline: from 00-installer-config.yaml and other non-xavs files
  // xavs:     from 90-xavs.yaml
  // spare detection: not in baseline files && no non-link-local addresses
  return {
    runtime: { links: JSON.parse(links), addrs: JSON.parse(addrs), routes: JSON.parse(routes) },
    yaml: yamlInfo
  };
}


js/writer.js

import yaml from "https://cdn.skypack.dev/js-yaml@4.1.0";

export function emitXavsYaml(model) {
  // model = { ethernets, vlans, bonds, bridges, overlays }
  const doc = {
    network: { version: 2, renderer: "networkd", ethernets: {}, vlans: {}, bonds: {}, bridges: {} }
  };

  // Emit XAVS-owned interfaces
  Object.assign(doc.network.ethernets, model.ethernets || {});
  Object.assign(doc.network.vlans,     model.vlans     || {});
  Object.assign(doc.network.bonds,     model.bonds     || {});
  Object.assign(doc.network.bridges,   model.bridges   || {});

  // Emit baseline overlays (safe-only keys)
  for (const [name, ov] of Object.entries(model.overlays || {})) {
    // Gate disallowed keys before write
    const blocked = ["addresses", "nameservers", "routes"].some(k => k in ov && ov.__mode !== "additive");
    if (blocked) throw new Error(`Overlay for ${name} contains disallowed replacing keys.`);
    doc.network.ethernets[name] = { ...(doc.network.ethernets[name]||{}), ...ov };
  }
  return yaml.dump(doc, { lineWidth: 120, noRefs: true });
}


js/apply.js

import { run } from "./run.js";

export async function applyPersistently(yamlStr, tryTimeout = 120) {
  await run(`install -m 600 /dev/stdin /etc/netplan/90-xavs.yaml.new <<'EOF'\n${yamlStr}\nEOF`);
  await run("sync && mv /etc/netplan/90-xavs.yaml.new /etc/netplan/90-xavs.yaml");
  await run("netplan generate --debug");
  await run(`netplan try --timeout ${tryTimeout}`); // UI shows countdown; on confirm, proceed:
  await run("netplan apply"); // harmless if try already confirmed
}


js/guardrails.js

export const canOverlay = (nic) => nic.isBaselineOwned;
export const canFullEdit = (nic) => !nic.isBaselineOwned;
export const canVlan     = (nic) => true; // VLAN on any parent
export const canBridge   = (nic) => nic.isSpare; // no baseline conflict
export const canBond     = (nics)=> nics.every(n => n.isSpare);


Overlay form whitelist (baseline NIC):

const OVERLAY_FIELDS = {
  mtu: "number", optional: "boolean", "accept-ra": "boolean",
  "dhcp4-overrides": { "route-metric": "number", "use-dns": "boolean", "use-routes": "boolean", "send-hostname": "boolean" },
  "dhcp6-overrides": { "route-metric": "number", "use-dns": "boolean", "use-routes": "boolean" },
  nameservers: { addresses: "string[]", search: "string[]" }, // only valid if dhcp4-overrides.use-dns === false
  routes_additive: [{ to: "string", via: "string", metric: "number?" }] // additive only
};

12) Test playbooks (to prevent regressions you hit before)

VLAN IP loss ‚Üí Unit test that any VLAN created stores its L3 on the VLAN, never on parent. Verify after try/rollback and apply. Pass criteria: IP persists across reboots and re‚Äëapplies. (Pattern mirrors upstream examples.) 
Ubuntu People

Routes preservation ‚Üí On add/edit, normalized writer always emits routes: under the owning interface. Verify merged view contains intended entries and metrics. (Default DHCP metric ~100.) 
Ubuntu People

Baseline overlay ‚Üí Attempt to ‚Äúreplace addresses‚Äù on baseline NIC must be blocked by UI validation; additive routes & DHCP overrides are permitted and persist.

Safe apply ‚Üí Cut over management‚Äëadjacent changes via netplan try and ensure auto‚Äërollback on no confirm @120s. 
Netplan

13) Phase‚Äë2 hooks (routing policy & advanced)

Keep table in routes and add routing-policy block to model for future source‚Äëbased routing; align with [RoutingPolicyRule] options (e.g., from, to, table, priority, incoming/outgoing IF, etc.). Netplan examples include PBR; systemd manpage enumerates rule knobs for when you‚Äôre ready. 
Ubuntu People
Ubuntu Manpages

Why this will scale in production

No file collisions. We never attempt a list‚Äëreplacement on a baseline NIC, which would backfire due to Netplan‚Äôs list‚Äëappend merge model. 
Ubuntu People

Zero baseline edits. You honor the constraint while still delivering powerful overlays, VLANs on top of baseline, and full control of XAVS‚Äëowned devices.

Deterministic apply. generate ‚Üí try(120s) ‚Üí apply minimizes outage risk for remote Cockpit sessions. 
Ubuntu Manpages

Operator clarity. The UI makes the ‚Äúoverlay vs full‚Äëedit‚Äù contract explicit with badges, gating, and diffs.

Citations you asked us to base on

Ubuntu Manpages

Final asks (quick yes/no to optimize the scaffolding)

Expose ‚ÄúDNS override‚Äù on baseline NICs by default? (This uses dhcp4-overrides.use-dns: false + static nameservers in overlay; safe & persistent.)

Default try timeout = 120s, or do you want a global knob (e.g., 180s) for STP/slow‚Äësettle environments?

OK to show a ‚ÄúPromote to XAVS ownership‚Äù wizard for a baseline NIC (purely advisory): it would export the effective baseline stanza to a file you can review manually later ‚Äî we will not apply or rename baseline, just generate a candidate YAML for change‚Äëmanagement review.

If you say ‚Äúgo‚Äù, I‚Äôll drop JSON schemas for the Overlay/VLAN/Bond/Bridge modals (with validation rules) so Copilot can generate the forms and wire them to your existing index.html and style.theme.css.
