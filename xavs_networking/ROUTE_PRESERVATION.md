# Route Preservation Implementation

## 🛡️ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

**Issue**: Netplan apply was deleting existing routes that weren't explicitly defined in netplan configuration, causing network connectivity loss.

**Root Cause**: The previous implementation only **warned** about missing routes after they were already deleted, but didn't **actively preserve** them.

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Active Route Preservation**

Instead of just checking routes after netplan apply, we now:

1. **Capture** important routes before netplan apply
2. **Preserve** them by actively restoring them after netplan apply
3. **Log** what was preserved for transparency

### **New Functions**

#### `captureAndPreserveRoutes()`
- Captures default gateway
- Identifies important static routes (excluding auto-generated ones)
- Filters out `scope link` and `proto kernel` routes (local network routes)
- Returns preservation object with route details

#### `restorePreservedRoutes(preservation)`
- Waits for netplan apply to settle (1 second delay)
- Restores each captured static route using `ip route add`
- Handles cases where routes already exist
- Provides detailed logging and user feedback

### **Updated Workflow**

**Before:**
```
1. Run netplan generate
2. Run netplan apply  
3. Check what routes were lost (warning only)
4. User loses connectivity 😞
```

**After:**
```
1. Capture important routes 🛡️
2. Run netplan generate
3. Run netplan apply
4. Restore preserved routes 🔄
5. User maintains connectivity 😊
```

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DETAILS**

### **Route Classification**

**Preserved Routes:**
- Static routes with explicit gateways (`via` keyword)
- Routes that don't include `scope link` or `proto kernel`
- Custom network routes that might be lost

**Not Preserved:**
- Local network routes (automatically recreated)
- Kernel-managed routes (`proto kernel`)
- Link-scope routes (`scope link`)

### **Implementation Highlights**

```javascript
// Example captured route
{
  network: "10.0.1.0/24",
  gateway: "192.168.1.1", 
  device: "eno1",
  original: "10.0.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eno1"
}

// Restoration command
ip route add 10.0.1.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eno1
```

### **Error Handling**

- Gracefully handles route capture failures
- Continues with netplan apply even if route capture fails
- Attempts route restoration but doesn't fail if individual routes can't be restored
- Provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

## 🧪 **TESTING**

### **Debug Functions**

```javascript
// Test route capture logic
testRoutePreservation()

// Test progress bar (existing)
testProgressBar()
```

### **Live Testing**

1. Set up some custom routes on your system
2. Apply a netplan configuration change
3. Verify routes are preserved after apply
4. Check console logs for preservation details

## 📊 **MONITORING**

### **Console Logs**

- `🛡️ Capturing routes for preservation...`
- `📍 Default gateway captured: X.X.X.X`
- `🔗 Static route captured: network via gateway dev device`
- `🔄 Restoring preserved routes...`
- `✅ Route restored: network via gateway`
- `✅ Route restoration completed: N routes restored`

### **User Feedback**

Success toast: `🛡️ Preserved N network routes during configuration apply`

## 🚀 **BENEFITS**

1. **Prevents Network Loss**: Routes are actively preserved instead of just warned about
2. **Maintains Connectivity**: Critical routes survive netplan apply operations
3. **Transparent Operation**: Detailed logging shows what's being preserved
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Continues operation even if some routes can't be restored
5. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications confirm successful preservation

## 📁 **FILES MODIFIED**

- `js/netplan-js-manager.js`: Added route preservation logic
- `ROUTE_PRESERVATION.md`: This documentation

## 🔮 **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

- Add netplan route integration (write routes to netplan config instead of restoring manually)
- Support for IPv6 route preservation
- Route priority preservation
- Integration with interface-specific route preservation

The route deletion issue should now be resolved! 🎉
