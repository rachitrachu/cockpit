echo "3. âœ… Error message: 'Configuration was automatically reverted for safety'"
echo "4. âœ… Console log: 'ðŸ”„ Configuration was reverted due to timeout'"
echo "5. âœ… Throws error to stop apply process (correct behavior)"

echo
echo "=== Test Instructions ==="
echo "To verify the complete fix:"
echo "1. Reload your Cockpit page to get the updated JavaScript"
echo "2. Go to XAVS Networking â†’ Change an interface IP"
echo "3. Wait for 10-second timeout (don't confirm)"
echo "4. Should see proper revert message, NOT 'Netplan try succeeded'"

echo
echo "=== What Changed ==="
echo "BEFORE: Backend returned {success: false, reverted: true, message: ...}"
echo "AFTER:  Backend returns {success: false, reverted: true, error: ..., message: ...}"
echo "IMPACT: Frontend now detects tryResult.error and handles revert properly"
