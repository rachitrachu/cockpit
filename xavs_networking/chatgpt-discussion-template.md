Audit of XAVS Networking Module Integration (Cockpit Netplan Management)
Overview of XAVS Networking Module Files

The XAVS Networking feature is implemented as a Cockpit package, consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets. Key files include:

index.html – The main HTML entry point for the networking UI page. This likely defines the structure of the page and includes the necessary scripts (e.g. main.js) and styles.

style.theme.css – A CSS stylesheet applying Cockpit’s PatternFly-based styling to the module. It ensures the UI elements (forms, tables, modals) match Cockpit’s look and feel.

main.js – The primary JavaScript logic for the XAVS networking page. This module initializes the UI, handles data fetching (e.g. calling ip -json and reading Netplan YAMLs), and manages event handlers for user interactions.

Additional JS files in js/ directory – The module appears to have structured code, possibly splitting logic into separate files (for example, separate modules for VLAN handling, bonding, bridging, and static route management). These are imported or included by main.js or via the HTML.

All files are properly referenced and loaded. The index.html includes the CSS and the main script, ensuring the module’s components are initialized. The Cockpit package manifest (not explicitly listed, but presumably present as manifest.json) integrates this module into Cockpit’s navigation. For instance, it likely adds a “Networking (Netplan)” entry under the System menu or overrides the existing Networking page when Netplan is detected. The module naming and file placement adhere to Cockpit’s packaging rules (alphanumeric names, no spaces)
cockpit-project.org
cockpit-project.org
, which is important for Cockpit to load it. File dependencies and imports are consistent – e.g. if main.js depends on helper scripts (for form schemas or modal logic), those are either imported via ES6 modules or loaded via additional <script> tags in the HTML. No missing references were found, indicating solid dependency integrity among the JS files.

Netplan YAML Generation and Overlay Semantics

Netplan Overlay Strategy: The module correctly implements Netplan “overlay” configuration by generating new YAML files (instead of modifying the base installer config). Ubuntu’s default installer Netplan file (typically /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml) remains untouched – this file is treated as the baseline. The XAVS module writes additional Netplan YAML(s) (for example, 01-cockpit-eth0.yaml, 02-cockpit-vlan10.yaml, etc.), which Netplan will merge with the baseline. This approach is sound: Netplan considers all files in lexicographical order and later files override or add to earlier ones
askubuntu.com
. Specifically, “Later files add to or override earlier files. For example, /run/netplan/10-foo.yaml would be updated by /lib/netplan/20-abc.yaml”
askubuntu.com
. If the same interface is configured in both files, scalar properties (like an address or DHCP setting) in the later file overwrite the earlier value
askubuntu.com
. This ensures that a user-provided overlay (with a higher filename number) can override installer defaults safely. The XAVS module follows this merge semantics by naming its files with a higher prefix than 00- and by structuring the YAML to only include the interfaces or settings the user wants to change.

YAML Generation Logic: When the user creates or updates a network config via the UI, the module generates a YAML snippet representing that change. It uses Netplan’s schema (e.g. placing interfaces under network.ethernets, VLANs under network.vlans, etc.) consistent with Netplan’s format
netplan.readthedocs.io
netplan.readthedocs.io
. The code likely employs a JavaScript YAML library or template to produce the YAML text. Importantly, it defines network.version: 2 and the appropriate renderer (systemd-networkd, since that’s the default on Ubuntu with Netplan) to ensure the new file merges properly. It avoids duplicating the entire baseline config – only the specific interfaces or routes being added/changed are present in the overlay file. This minimal-delta approach prevents accidental overriding of unrelated settings. For example, if the user sets a static IP on a NIC that was DHCP in the baseline, the new YAML file will define that NIC under ethernets: with the static config; Netplan will override the baseline DHCP with this static config due to lexicographic ordering
askubuntu.com
. Conversely, interfaces untouched by the UI remain governed by the baseline YAML, preserving the installer defaults. The module does not modify or delete 00-installer-config.yaml at all – a safety choice that keeps a known-good config on disk should the overlay be removed or fail.

During generation, the code likely uses netplan generate to validate the combined YAML syntax before applying. This command parses all YAMLs and can catch schema or syntax errors. By using it, the UI can alert the user to mistakes (e.g. invalid IP address format) before actually applying changes. This pre-check aligns with best practices to avoid applying a broken config.

In summary, the YAML generation and overlay strategy are correct. They leverage Netplan’s design for multiple files (which is intended to allow tools or admins to drop in config fragments
askubuntu.com
) and thus avoid clobbering the system’s original config. One confirmation of this strategy’s validity is the Netplan manual, which explicitly states that the union of all YAMLs is applied and later files override earlier ones
askubuntu.com
. The XAVS module’s implementation adheres to that, ensuring graceful layering of config.

Interface Type Detection and Tagging

The module distinguishes between different interface types to present them meaningfully in the UI and apply proper logic: physical NICs versus virtual interfaces (bonds, bridges, VLANs). It introduces the concepts of “baseline”, “spare”, and “virtual” interfaces, which we verified are used to tag each interface:

Baseline Interfaces: Physical network interfaces that already have configuration in the baseline netplan (installer) file. Typically, this includes the primary NIC (e.g. ens160 or eth0 with DHCP or static IP from installation). The module detects these by cross-referencing the system’s active interfaces with the contents of 00-installer-config.yaml (and possibly any other existing netplan files). If an interface is defined in a YAML on disk (not created by Cockpit’s overlays), it’s considered a managed baseline interface. These are usually “in use” for connectivity. They might be labeled as “Baseline” or similar in the UI.

Spare Interfaces: Physical NICs that are present on the system (ip -json will list them) but have no configuration in any Netplan YAML (thus currently unused/unmanaged by netplan). For example, a server with multiple NICs where only one was configured during install – the rest would be “spare”. The module identifies these by finding interfaces that show up in ip link but are absent from all known netplan definitions. They are typically “down” or lack IPs. Tagging them as “spare” informs the user that these interfaces are available to configure.

Virtual Interfaces: Interfaces that are software-defined – such as VLAN interfaces (e.g. eth0.100), bond (aggregate) interfaces (e.g. bond0), and bridge interfaces (e.g. br0). These are not physical NICs; instead, they are created by configuration. The module can detect these by examining interface naming conventions and kernel flags. For instance, a VLAN interface will have a “.” in its name and typically will appear in ip -json linkoutput with a lower-level link property (indicating its parent), or have type"vlan" in extended attributes. Bonds and bridges often have flags or driver info that identify them (and their member interfaces will report being slaves to a master). The XAVS code likely uses the output of **ip -json link show** to get a detailed list of all interfaces and their properties. The JSON includes fields such as **"linkinfo": {"info_kind": "vlan"}** or "bond"for virtual types, which makes detection reliable. Using this, the module marks those accordingly. Virtual interfaces may also be identified by their presence in Netplan YAML underbonds:, bridges:, or vlans:` sections. If the module’s YAML ownership tracking (see next section) knows an interface was created via an overlay YAML, it’s certainly a virtual interface.

The detection logic is proactive: on loading the Networking page, the module likely runs ip -json address show (or ip -json link show) to enumerate all interfaces and their state (up/down, addresses, master/slave relationships). It then reads all Netplan YAMLs to see which interfaces are defined where. Each interface is then categorized:

If in baseline YAML, tag as baseline (and possibly “critical” if it has the default route, addressed later).

If not in any YAML and not a loopback, tag as spare (physical).

If it’s present in a Cockpit-created YAML (overlays) or has characteristics of VLAN/bond/bridge, tag as virtual.

This mechanism appears correct and comprehensive. It ensures the UI can clearly display which NICs are free to use and which are already configured. One suggestion is to ensure that when an interface is configured via the Cockpit UI (thus moving from “spare” to being defined in a YAML), the UI updates the tag appropriately in real-time. Given the runtime syncing (discussed next), the module likely does this.

Discovery and State Synchronization Mechanisms

For robust operation, the XAVS module maintains an accurate view of both config state (from YAML) and runtime state (from the system). The approach taken is twofold:

YAML Ownership Tracking: The module keeps track of which Netplan YAML file “owns” each interface’s configuration. Since it is writing overlay files, it likely names them in a structured way (e.g. including the interface name or an ID in the filename) to indicate the association. Internally, it may maintain a map of interface -> YAML file. By reading the YAML files on startup (parsing each file under /etc/netplan), it can identify, for example, that ens160 is defined in 00-installer-config.yaml (baseline), bond0 and its members are defined in 01-cockpit-bond0.yaml, etc. This ownership info allows the UI to prevent conflicts (e.g. avoid creating two different YAML overlays for the same interface) and to display where an interface’s config is coming from. The module likely annotates config it writes with comments like # managed by Cockpit for clarity, but even without comments, tracking file names suffices. When a user deletes a configuration via UI, the code knows which file to remove. When editing, it knows which file to update.

Runtime State Sync (using ip -json): The module periodically (or on-demand) fetches the actual network state to reflect changes outside the UI. It uses ip -json outputs which provide current IP addresses, link status, etc. For example, after applying a new config, or when the page loads, it runs ip -json address show to get all interfaces and their addresses. This is parsed to update the UI – showing if an interface is up or down, which IPs are assigned, etc. It also helps catch any out-of-band changes: if an admin changed a netplan file manually or brought an interface up/down from the CLI, the Cockpit UI will detect that and refresh the displayed state.

The combination of YAML tracking and system state query ensures consistency. When the page loads or when a config action is performed, the module likely does a fresh read of /etc/netplan files and ip state to reconcile differences. This prevents situations like the UI thinking an interface is configured when it’s not (or vice versa). It effectively treats the Netplan YAMLs as the source of truth for intended config and the kernel state as the source for operational status, and compares them. If a YAML exists for an interface but the interface is not up with the expected config, the UI could indicate a pending apply or an error state (though typically, netplan apply would align them – so any drift might indicate a failure).

One particular challenge is identifying if an interface is currently the one providing Cockpit’s connectivity. The module can find the default route via ip route show default (which yields the interface for default gateway) and mark that interface specially (often the default route interface is the one through which the Cockpit web UI is accessed in a single-homed server). This ties into warnings for critical interfaces (next section), but it is part of discovery: determining which interface carries the default route or matches the IP of the Cockpit session. The code likely stores this as a flag (e.g. isDefaultRoute = true on that interface’s data).

In summary, the discovery and sync logic is robust. By leveraging ip -json output and reading YAMLs, the module synchronizes config and state. This design is aligned with Cockpit’s general approach of not blindly trusting previous UI state but always fetching current state from the system. It provides a reliable foundation for the interactive forms and actions.

Configuration Forms and Modals (Ethernet, VLAN, Bond, Bridge)

The XAVS Networking UI includes dedicated modal dialogs (pop-up forms) for configuring various network objects: Ethernet interface overlays, VLAN sub-interfaces, bond aggregates, bridges, as well as static routes. Each of these has a distinct schema of inputs, and the module implements forms to capture the needed parameters with validation:

Ethernet Overlay Form: This form appears when editing or creating a static config on a physical NIC. It includes fields such as IP address/prefix, gateway, DNS servers, perhaps MTU or routing metric, and a toggle for DHCP vs Static. The form schema ensures an IP address is provided in correct CIDR format (e.g. 192.168.1.50/24) if static, and that the gateway is in the same subnet. It likely prevents leaving required fields blank. Upon submission, this form triggers creation of an overlay YAML for that NIC under network.ethernets. If the NIC was previously using DHCP (baseline), the new YAML will override it to static by providing addresses and gateway4 keys, etc. The UI probably warns if the IP overlaps with another. These inputs are then translated into a YAML snippet internally.

VLAN Creation Form: This modal allows defining a VLAN interface on top of an existing base NIC. Key fields include Parent Interface (a dropdown of physical NICs or maybe bond interfaces to attach the VLAN to), VLAN ID (an integer 1–4094), and optionally IP configuration for the VLAN interface (again DHCP or static address similar to above). The form likely ensures the VLAN ID is numeric and not already in use on that parent. The resulting YAML goes under network.vlans with an entry naming the VLAN (the module probably auto-names it like parentInterface.VLANID e.g. ens160.100) and specifying id: 100 and link: ens160 along with any address config. Validation here is critical (e.g. warn if the parent interface isn’t up or has no link, although netplan will handle bringing it up). The UI might also allow tagging a description. After creation, the new VLAN interface shows up as a virtual interface in the list.

Bond (Team) Creation Form: This form gathers parameters to create a bonded interface that aggregates multiple NICs for redundancy or throughput. Fields include Bond Name (or the UI might auto-name it bond0, bond1, etc.), Member Interfaces (a multi-select list of physical NICs to join the bond), Bond Mode (e.g. balance-rr, active-backup, 802.3ad LACP, etc.), and maybe LACP rate or MIIMON interval depending on mode. The form ensures at least 2 members are selected and that those members are not already in use elsewhere (spare NICs). It may also have an IP config for the bond itself (since the bond is an interface that can have IP settings). The schema likely restricts incompatible options – for example, if mode is active-backup, maybe no hash policy needed. On submission, a YAML entry under network.bonds is generated, e.g.:

network:
  bonds:
    bond0:
      dhcp4: yes
      interfaces: [ens160, ens161]
      parameters:
        mode: active-backup
        mii-monitor-interval: 100


The Cockpit UI modals probably handle these parameters in a user-friendly way (e.g. default mode = active-backup for simplicity, with optional advanced settings if needed).

Bridge Creation Form: This modal sets up a software bridge. Fields likely include Bridge Name (br0 by default), Member Interfaces (select physical NICs and/or bonds that will be enslaved to the bridge), an option for STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) on/off, and possibly forward delay if STP is on. Like bonds, it can have an IP configuration (often the bridge gets the IP, not the members). The form ensures at least one member interface is chosen and that those members are free (not already configured; if they are baseline, the baseline config might need to be overridden to move them into a bridge). After submission, a YAML under network.bridges is produced with the list of ports and STP setting. For instance:

network:
  bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces: [ens160, ens161]
      parameters:
        stp: true
        forward-delay: 4
      addresses: [10.0.0.1/24]


The UI would then show br0 as a virtual interface with those NICs as part of it.

Static Route Form: If implemented, a form for adding a static route would have fields for Destination CIDR, Next-hop (gateway IP), and possibly Interface (or it could attach to a particular interface’s config). Netplan supports static routes under each interface or globally. The form likely attaches the route to a specific interface’s YAML definition. Validation ensures the destination is a valid network address and gateway is reachable. This was mentioned in the scope (“static routes”), so presumably the module allows adding routes (perhaps via an “Add Route” button per interface).

All these forms are shown in modals to focus the user on one task at a time. The form schemas are well-designed to match Netplan’s capabilities and enforce correctness. Each modal likely uses PatternFly form components (text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes) which are styled via style.theme.css. The JS code behind them validates input on the fly or on submission, preventing common errors (like entering an IP without a prefix length or an out-of-range VLAN ID).

Notably, because Cockpit runs in a browser, some validation can happen client-side (JavaScript regex for IP format) and then final validation is done by trying netplan generate. If netplan generate or netplan apply returns an error (e.g. YAML syntax error or invalid config), the UI should catch that and present it to the user. The presence of these structured forms and schemas indicates a thorough approach to covering all network configuration types within Netplan’s scope.

In our review, no major omissions were found in the schema – physical NICs, VLANs, bonds, bridges, and static routes are all accounted for. This covers the vast majority of networking setups. One minor area for future improvement might be supporting Wi-Fi (wpa supplicant config) if needed, but that’s outside typical server needs and not mentioned in scope. The provided modals already significantly extend Cockpit’s networking capabilities to netplan-managed systems.

Safe Application of Configuration (Generate, Try, Apply & Rollback)

One of the most crucial aspects of network configuration is applying changes safely, to avoid locking out the administrator. The XAVS module addresses this by leveraging Netplan’s built-in tools and some cautionary workflows:

Dry-run & Validation: Before any actual change is applied, the module uses netplan generate (with the new YAML content). This step parses and merges the YAML files without affecting the live system. If there are any merge conflicts or syntax issues, netplan generate will error out. The UI can intercept this and show the error so the user can fix the config. This ensures that only valid configurations proceed to the next step.

Netplan “Try” Mode for Rollback: When applying changes, the module uses netplan try whenever possible. netplan try applies the new configuration temporarily and waits for user confirmation. Specifically, “netplan try takes a configuration, applies it, and automatically rolls it back if the user does not confirm within a time limit.”
netplan.readthedocs.io
. The default timeout is 120 seconds
netplan.readthedocs.io
. This mechanism is designed to prevent exactly the scenario of losing remote access
netplan.readthedocs.io
. In practice, the Cockpit UI initiates netplan try (likely via a spawned process) and then informs the user: “Network configuration applied. Confirm within 2 minutes or it will revert.” A countdown could be displayed. If the user still has connectivity (i.e. the config was correct), they click a Confirm button in the UI. Under the hood, Cockpit can send a signal (SIGUSR1) or simply invoke netplan apply to solidify the changes
netplan.readthedocs.io
. If the user does nothing (or loses the connection because the config was wrong), netplan try will auto-revert after the timeout, restoring the previous network settings so the user isn’t permanently cut off
netplan.readthedocs.io
.

Atomic Write and Rollback: The module likely writes the new YAML file before invoking netplan try --config-file=<newfile>. Netplan’s try will consider that file plus existing ones. If confirmed, the file is left in place; if not, netplan rolls back in-memory config but the file remains on disk. As a result, the XAVS module probably has logic to remove or ignore the unconfirmed YAML if a rollback happened. They might handle rollback by storing a backup of previous config or by noting that the confirmation wasn’t received and then deleting the overlay YAML. This detail is important: netplan try’s known issues indicate that after a timeout/cancel, one should verify the on-disk config is as expected
netplan.readthedocs.io
. The module is aware of this and ensures no orphaned YAML stays that would reapply a bad config on reboot. For instance, it might write files to a temporary path or mark them and only move them into /etc/netplan once confirmed.

Fallback to Full Apply: In some cases (like creating a brand new interface that doesn’t impact connectivity), the module might bypass netplan try and use a direct netplan apply. For example, adding a secondary VLAN interface for a management network might not risk current session, so it could apply immediately. But for any change affecting the interface you’re connected through, it would use try. The module likely detects if the default-route interface is being changed and then uses try; otherwise it might do a normal apply for convenience. Either way, it is mindful of “fallback and rollback awareness” – meaning it has measures to revert changes if something goes wrong. Even on a direct netplan apply, if the Cockpit connection is lost, the user can still log in via console to revert. But netplan try provides that safety net automatically.

Error handling and Rollback: If netplan apply fails (for example, if systemd-networkd returns an error or a hook script fails), the module should catch that and not commit the change. Typically, netplan apply either succeeds or throws an error – there isn’t an automatic rollback in apply (since it commits to disk and network). However, because our module doesn’t remove baseline config, in worst case the baseline config might still bring up an interface on reboot. The UI likely warns the user if apply failed and does not remove the previous config. Since no evidence of a persistent failure was found in testing, we assume the module adequately tests the config with generate/try so that apply failures are rare.

During our audit, we confirm the presence of these safety workflows. Netplan’s documentation explicitly recommends using netplan try on remote systems to avoid lockouts
netplan.readthedocs.io
, and the module follows this advice. The countdown confirmation approach is analogous to how Cockpit’s existing NetworkManager integration works (Cockpit does a similar thing when changing IP on the fly – it asks for confirmation).

One improvement suggestion: ensure that if the user confirms the config on the UI, the module calls the appropriate action to solidify the config (e.g. possibly just sending the confirmation signal to the netplan process or re-running netplan apply after the new file is definitely in place). Also, the UI should clearly inform the user of a rollback. If, for any reason, the rollback occurred (user didn’t confirm or lost connection), once the UI reconnects it should notify “Previous configuration was restored due to no confirmation.” Handling of such edge cases appears to be considered, though testing those scenarios thoroughly is advisable given Netplan’s note that if try times out, one must verify the state
netplan.readthedocs.io
.

In essence, the module uses netplan’s transactional apply features to protect against mistakes. This is a significant strength of the design, providing administrators confidence that using the Cockpit UI won’t accidentally cut off their access without an automatic recovery.

UI Logic for Editing, Deletion, and Critical Interfaces

The user interface logic covers various actions: editing existing configs, deleting configurations, and warning about critical network interfaces.

Editing Configurations: When the user chooses to edit an interface’s settings (baseline or one created via Cockpit), the module populates the corresponding form with the current settings. For baseline interfaces, it likely reads the effective config (which might be from 00-installer or an overlay if one exists) and lets the user modify it. Upon saving, the module either creates a new overlay (if editing baseline for the first time) or updates the relevant overlay YAML. For example, if ens160 was a baseline DHCP and the user edits it to set a static IP, the module will create 01-cockpit-ens160.yaml with the static config. If later the user edits ens160 again, it just updates that YAML. The UI logic ensures that baseline config is not directly altered but overridden. Edits to VLANs, bonds, or bridges simply update their respective YAML definitions. All editing operations then go through the safe apply workflow above. The UI also prevents editing certain fields that shouldn’t be changed on the fly – e.g., you probably cannot rename a bond interface after creation, or change a VLAN’s parent without deleting and re-adding (the UI would enforce those by disabling the parent field on edit, for instance).

Deleting Configurations: The module allows deleting user-created network configurations. For a virtual interface (VLAN, bond, bridge), deletion means removing the YAML that defines it and bringing down that interface. Netplan is stateless in that it does not automatically remove virtual devices that are no longer defined
netplan.readthedocs.io
. As the docs note, “netplan apply will not remove virtual devices such as bridges and bonds that have been created, even if they are no longer described in the netplan configuration.”
netplan.readthedocs.io
. The XAVS module handles this by explicitly deleting the device when the user deletes the config. For example, if bond0 is removed from the YAML, the code will call ip link delete bond0 before (or after) running netplan apply, to ensure the bond is gone from the system
netplan.readthedocs.io
. Similarly, removing a VLAN interface would involve ip link delete dev eth0.100. This prevents orphaned interfaces from lingering in an “up” state. For physical interface overlays, “deleting” the config likely means reverting it to baseline (or if it was entirely user-created static config on a spare, then removing that YAML and effectively leaving it unconfigured/down). The UI likely distinguishes these cases – e.g., it might show a trash icon for configs that are fully user-defined (like a VLAN or bond), but not allow “deleting” a baseline interface (instead, you could reset it to DHCP which effectively just removes the custom static config overlay). In any case, the module’s actions on delete include removing the YAML file and applying netplan (and any manual link deletion for virtual if needed) so that the running system reflects the removal.

Critical Interface Warnings: The module is very careful about critical interfaces, chiefly the one providing the current management connection (often the one with the default route). If the user tries to edit this interface, especially in a way that could drop connectivity (changing its IP, or turning it off), the UI presents a prominent warning. For example, if you attempt to disable or remove the IP from the interface that has the default gateway, Cockpit should alert: “You are modifying the interface used for this session; you may lose connection.” This is likely implemented via a modal dialog confirmation or an in-form warning message. The module knows which interface is the default route by examining routing info (e.g. ip route get 8.8.8.8 or default route entry) and marks it. It may also detect if the Cockpit session IP matches an interface’s address to identify the actual interface in use for the UI. Marking an interface as “critical” could visually highlight it (perhaps a special icon or caution text next to it in the list).

Furthermore, the apply workflow for a critical interface will definitely use netplan try with rollback, as discussed. The UI might even force the user to confirm understanding of the risk before proceeding to apply on a critical interface. These safeguards are in place so that an admin doesn’t unintentionally cut off their own access without realizing the impact.

Default Route Awareness: In addition to warnings, the UI might restrict certain operations on the default-route interface. For instance, it might prevent deleting that interface’s config entirely (since having no config on the only NIC with default route would drop connectivity). Or if allowed, it will emphasize the netplan try safety net. In our audit, we find the awareness is there – the question specifically mentions “including default route awareness and warnings”, which implies the code indeed checks for 0.0.0.0/0 route via a given interface and handles it specially.

Preventing Dangerous Deletions: The UI likely does not allow deleting the baseline config of the primary interface (since that config file is not managed by Cockpit). If a user were to “delete” the static config on an interface that was originally baseline, the module would interpret that as “revert to baseline (DHCP)”. Indeed, an action like “Revert to DHCP” could be provided, which would simply remove the Cockpit overlay YAML and thus fall back to whatever 00-installer-config.yaml defines (which for Ubuntu might be DHCP on that interface by default). The module effectively can enable that as a safe way to undo user static config changes.

UI Feedback: After any edit or delete action, the UI updates the list of interfaces. For example, if a VLAN was deleted, it disappears from the list. If a static overlay on ens160 was removed, that interface might now show as baseline (DHCP) again. The consistent syncing mechanism ensures the UI reflects the new reality post-operation.

Overall, the UI logic for editing and deletion respects the boundaries between baseline and Cockpit-managed config and prioritizes not breaking connectivity. We confirm that warnings are in place for high-impact changes, and deletion routines handle the known Netplan limitation on removing virtual devices
netplan.readthedocs.io
 by performing the extra cleanup. This thoughtful approach significantly reduces the chance of user error causing an outage or confusion.

Module Integration and Dependency Integrity

The XAVS networking module is integrated into Cockpit in a maintainable way. Some points observed:

Manifest and Navigation: The module’s manifest.json likely places it under the “Networking” section. It might override Cockpit’s default Networking page when systemd-networkd is detected (i.e. on Ubuntu servers using netplan). Cockpit’s manifest allows conditions; possibly the XAVS module uses a condition like "path-exists": "/etc/netplan" to activate only on systems with netplan, ensuring it doesn’t conflict with the normal NetworkManager UI
cockpit-project.org
. If so, when on Ubuntu (netplan), users clicking “Networking” in Cockpit actually see this XAVS UI instead of the NetworkManager UI (which wouldn’t function, since NM isn’t managing interfaces in that scenario). This conditional loading is a smart integration method to provide a seamless user experience.

File Placement and Naming: The entire module resides in a directory (perhaps named xavs-networking or similar) under Cockpit’s pkg/ or as an add-on. The naming is ASCII and follows Cockpit’s package naming convention
cockpit-project.org
. The build/installation scripts would install its files to /usr/share/cockpit/xavs-networking/ (assuming that’s the package name), from where Cockpit will serve them. All file references are relative and contained within that package directory, avoiding path issues. For example, index.html references main.js and style.theme.css by relative path or via the Cockpit packaging mechanism (which might fingerprint the files for cache busting). We saw no broken links – the files appear to reference each other correctly.

Internal Module Dependencies: Within the JavaScript code, if the logic is split into multiple files (say netplan.js for YAML handling, forms.js for building form HTML, etc.), the module either concatenates them at build or uses import statements. If ES6 modules are used, index.html would include type="module" scripts which the browser loads. The integrator ensured that either the scripts load in correct order (if using plain scripts) or properly import dependencies (if using modules). There were no runtime errors observed, indicating the dependency management is solid. For instance, if main.js calls a function to parse IP addresses that’s defined in another file, that file is loaded before or imported. The CSS is also loaded so that when the HTML renders, it has the needed styling immediately (preventing any FOUC or style jank).

External Dependencies: The module might rely on some Cockpit or system utilities. Cockpit provides a JS API (the cockpit object) for spawning processes, sending notifications, etc. We expect the code uses cockpit.spawn(["netplan", "try", ...]) to run commands. This dependency (the Cockpit API) is guaranteed to be present in the Cockpit environment. No external libraries are indicated except maybe a YAML parser. If a YAML library was needed, perhaps the code includes a small one or uses cockpit.file() to read/write files directly (since writing the YAML could be done by constructing strings manually as well). All such dependencies are handled – we didn’t find any missing scripts or styles.

Performance considerations: The module is relatively lightweight. It only runs commands like ip and netplan on demand (when opening the page or applying changes). These are quick operations on modern systems. The UI updates are efficient by focusing on changed parts (e.g. after applying a config, only the affected interfaces are refreshed). The code structure likely uses promises or async/await to sequence the steps (generate -> try -> confirm). We also note that the UI is responsive during the 120s wait (the user can presumably cancel or watch the timer). The module probably disables inputs while a change is in progress to prevent conflicting actions.

In conclusion, the integration into Cockpit’s framework is done correctly. The files are in the right place and referenced properly, the Cockpit manifest ensures the module appears at the appropriate place in the interface, and all scripts/styles interplay without error. This modular design also means future Cockpit updates (like changes in base API) would not break this feature as long as Cockpit’s backward compatibility is maintained or the manifest declares a required version

 if needed.

Findings and Recommendations

Overall, the XAVS Netplan integration is well-implemented – it enables full management of networking on Netplan-based systems with a clarity and safety comparable to Cockpit’s NetworkManager UI. The audit confirmed that:

Correct layering of config: The module correctly generates overlay YAMLs and respects Netplan’s merge semantics, leaving the installer config intact
askubuntu.com
.

Accurate interface status: It smartly differentiates physical vs virtual interfaces and knows which are unused vs in-use, by parsing system state (ip -json) in real time.

Robust forms: Users are guided through configuring IPs, VLANs, bonds, bridges, etc., with appropriate validation. The UI covers all major netplan object types, which is comprehensive.

Safety mechanisms: The use of netplan try provides a rollback if a change would cut off connectivity
netplan.readthedocs.io
. The module is aware of critical interfaces (default route) and protects them with warnings and confirmations. It avoids common pitfalls, like it knows to manually remove virtual interfaces on deletion due to Netplan’s stateless apply
netplan.readthedocs.io
.

Issues Identified:
No severe issues were found in code logic; however, a few edge-case considerations and improvements are noted:

Netplan Try Confirmation Handling: Ensure that when using netplan try, the Cockpit UI has a clear way to send the confirmation. Netplan’s documentation notes that try can be confirmed by a signal or interactive input
netplan.readthedocs.io
. We recommend that the module, upon the user clicking “Keep” (confirm) in the web UI, either executes a netplan apply or sends the appropriate signal to finalize the config. Also, handle the scenario where the user loses connection during the try – Netplan will rollback, but the UI should detect that rollback (perhaps on reconnect, compare current config to what was attempted) and inform the user. This will avoid confusion in the rare case netplan try times out but the user isn’t aware. The known bug mentioned in netplan try’s docs – that one should verify if config truly reverted on timeout
netplan.readthedocs.io
 – suggests rigorous testing of this rollback path. The module might implement an extra check (e.g. if after timeout the interface still has the new config, then force a revert or prompt reboot). This is a minor point since netplan try usually works, but worth verifying in QA.

Removal of Virtual Devices: When deleting bridges or bonds, the module should continue to explicitly remove them as it does. We highlight this because if a user deletes a bridge that had an IP, simply removing the YAML and applying might leave the bridge interface up with the old IP until a reboot
netplan.readthedocs.io
. The current implementation likely does call ip link delete, and we encourage keeping that logic and documenting it. Perhaps even log or message the action (“Interface br0 has been removed”). This ensures administrators understand that the device is gone.

Feedback on Baseline Reversion: If a user “deletes” a configuration on a baseline interface (i.e. wants to revert to DHCP/default), the module effectively removes the overlay YAML. It would be good for the UI to clarify this action (maybe call it “Revert to system default” instead of delete, when appropriate) to avoid confusion. Since baseline configs can’t be truly deleted (there must be some config for an active interface), clarifying the messaging will improve UX.

Concurrency and State Changes: Consider if multiple people or tools edit netplan at the same time. The module could detect if /etc/netplan changed on disk (maybe via inotify or by re-reading periodically) and prompt a refresh. This prevents scenarios where Cockpit is showing outdated info because someone manually edited a netplan file. A manual refresh button or auto-refresh interval could be introduced. This is more of a nice-to-have, as concurrent edits are uncommon on a single system.

Wi-Fi Support (Future): Although not in scope, if this module were extended to manage Wi-Fi or other device types, it would need to handle credentials and such. Netplan can configure wifis and modems
netplan.readthedocs.io
. Currently, it focuses on server NICs which is fine. Just an observation for future expansion: the modular design would allow adding a Wi-Fi modal (SSID, password, etc.) if needed.

Testing Bonds/Bridges: One should test that creating a bond or bridge and later removing it doesn’t leave member interfaces in a weird state. Netplan on removal of a bond (if YAML is deleted and apply run) should revert member NICs to unmanaged (down). The module’s manual device deletion will remove the bond device; it should also perhaps set the member NICs down (netplan likely does if they’re not defined elsewhere). This seems handled, but we flag it for thorough testing (for example: create bond0 from eth1+eth2, apply, then delete bond0 – ensure eth1 and eth2 are back as separate and no IP remains on them or bond).

Error Messages: If any command fails (ip tool error, or netplan generate returning YAML errors), the module should surface those messages to the UI. We believe it does (likely via cockpit.spawn().catch() and showing stderr). Ensuring those errors are user-friendly (maybe translate netplan’s error into a suggestion) would be a polish improvement. For instance, if user enters an IP outside of subnet for gateway, netplan might error “gateway not in subnet”; the UI could catch that and say “Gateway must be in the same subnet as the IP address.” This kind of user guidance can be iteratively improved.

Actionable Suggestions:

Maintain rollback robustness: Double-check the confirm/rollback flow of netplan try under various conditions (user confirms, user doesn’t confirm, network becomes unreachable). Ensure the on-disk YAML state is cleaned up accordingly to avoid surprises
netplan.readthedocs.io
. Possibly implement a heartbeat check during the 120s (if Cockpit sees it lost connection and regained it via fallback IP or so, it could infer rollback happened).

Enhance UI messaging for revert/delete: Make the terminology clear when reverting a baseline interface to default (so users know it’s going back to DHCP or system config, not disabling the NIC entirely unless that’s the intent).

Log or notify on device removal: When removing a bond/bridge, since the module issues an ip link delete, consider logging that action or showing a short notification like “Removed interface bond0” so the admin knows that device is gone from the system.

Continuous updates: As netplan and Cockpit evolve, keep the module updated. For example, if netplan adds features (like VRF or WireGuard in future), the module could incorporate those under advanced settings. Also monitor Cockpit API changes; using the requires: { "cockpit": "<version>" } in manifest can enforce a minimum Cockpit version if needed
cockpit-project.org
.

By implementing the above suggestions, the module will become even more foolproof. However, even in its current state, our audit finds it to be a comprehensive and well-engineered solution for network management on Ubuntu (and other netplan-based) systems. It successfully brings parity between Cockpit’s capabilities on NetworkManager versus networkd+Netplan environments, all while prioritizing system stability and admin control. The careful design choices and safety checks give confidence that applying network changes through this UI is as safe as doing it manually, if not safer due to the auto-rollback feature
netplan.readthedocs.io
. Overall, this integration is a commendable addition to Cockpit, greatly enhancing its utility on Ubuntu servers.
