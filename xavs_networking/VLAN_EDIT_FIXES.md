# VLAN Edit Function Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. IP Address Parsing Problems
**Problem**: The `getVlanDetailsFromSystem` function had flawed regex parsing that couldn't properly extract multiple IP addresses from the `ip a` output.

**Fix**: 
- Completely rewrote the IP parsing logic to process line-by-line
- Added proper interface block detection using state machine logic
- Fixed regex patterns to correctly match IP addresses with CIDR notation
- Added support for secondary IP addresses

### 2. Incomplete IP Address Collection
**Problem**: The edit function wasn't retrieving all IP addresses configured on a VLAN interface.

**Fix**:
- Added fresh system data retrieval before opening edit dialog
- Improved IP address array handling in the edit function
- Enhanced the `ipAddresses` array population logic
- Added fallback handling for legacy single IP storage

### 3. Edit Function Data Refresh Issues
**Problem**: Edit function was using stale data instead of current system state.

**Fix**:
- Added automatic data refresh in `handleEditVlan` function
- Implemented fresh system query before populating edit form
- Enhanced error handling for data refresh operations

### 4. Gateway and DNS Detection
**Problem**: Gateway and DNS information wasn't being properly retrieved from system.

**Fix**:
- Added route parsing to detect gateway for specific interfaces
- Implemented Netplan config file parsing for DNS servers
- Added proper error handling for missing configuration

### 5. Form Population Logic
**Problem**: The `populateEditIpAddresses` function had issues with multiple IP entries.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced error checking for DOM elements
- Improved logging for debugging
- Fixed counter management for multiple IP entries
- Added proper validation for empty/undefined IP arrays

## New Features Added

1. **Force Refresh Function**: `VlanManager.refreshVlanData()` to reload all VLAN data
2. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the process
3. **Test Functions**: Added `testVlanIpParsing()` and `testParsingLogic()` for validation
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback behavior

## Testing

You can test the fixes by:

1. **In Browser Console**:
   ```javascript
   // Test IP parsing logic
   testParsingLogic();
   
   // Test real VLAN IP parsing (requires VLANs to exist)
   testVlanIpParsing();
   
   // Force refresh VLAN data
   VlanManager.refreshVlanData();
   ```

2. **Edit Function**: Try editing a VLAN that has multiple IP addresses configured
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check browser console for detailed logging during edit operations

## Key Improvements

- **Multiple IP Support**: Now properly handles VLANs with multiple IP addresses
- **Real-time Data**: Always uses fresh system data when editing
- **Better Validation**: Improved form validation and error handling
- **Enhanced Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

The edit function should now properly:
- Display all IP addresses configured on a VLAN
- Show correct gateway and DNS information
- Handle both static and DHCP configurations
- Refresh data before editing to ensure accuracy
