## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Cockpit web console installed and running
- Kolla-Ansible environment configured
- Inventory file at `/root/xdeploy/nodes`
- Python virtual environment at `/opt/xenv/`

### Installation
1. Copy the `xavs-deploy` directory to your Cockpit modules directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r xavs-deploy /usr/share/cockpit/
   ```

2. Access via Cockpit web interface:
   ```
   https://your-server:9090/xavs-deploy
   ```

### Configuration
The application automatically detects:
- **Inventory File**: `/root/xdeploy/nodes` (configurable)
- **Virtual Environment**: `/opt/xenv/bin/activate`
- **Available Hosts**: Parsed from inventory file
- **Available Services**: Pre-configured service tags

- **Monitoring**: prometheus, grafana, fluentd
- **Networking**: openvswitch, linuxbridge
- **Storage**: ceph, nfs, manila

## Host Management

### All Hosts Mode
- Deploy to all hosts in inventory
- Default and recommended mode

### Limit Hosts Mode  
- Target specific hosts using `--limit`
- Individual host selection
- Group targeting support

### Tag-Based Selection
- Use service tags for targeted deployments
- Multiple tag selection supported
- Automatic tag validation

## Safety Guidelines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Dangerous Commands
The following commands require extra confirmation:
- **stop**: Stops all OpenStack services
- **destroy**: Completely removes the deployment  
- **prune-images**: Removes unused Docker images

### üîÑ Backup Recommendations
Before performing destructive operations:
1. Run database backup: `mariadb_backup`
2. Create configuration backup
3. Document current deployment state
4. Test restore procedures

### ‚úÖ Best Practices
- Always use `--check` for dry runs first
- Start with limited hosts for testing
- Monitor progress in real-time
- Keep backups current
- Follow the official SOP documentation

```

### Fallback Text Parsing
When JSON output is not available, the system parses standard Ansible text output for:
- Task names from `TASK [...]` lines
- Play names from `PLAY [...]` lines  
- Task results from `ok:`, `changed:`, `failed:`, etc. lines

### Progress State Management
The application tracks:
- Current playbook name
- Task completion statistics
- Individual task results with metadata
- Overall deployment status

## Configuration

### Dynamic Host Loading
The inventory file path is set to `/root/xdeploy/nodes` and the system automatically:
- **Parses inventory file** on startup to extract all available hosts
- **Groups hosts by sections** (control, compute, network, storage, etc.)
- **Provides host selection UI** with individual checkboxes for targeted deployments
- **Includes refresh functionality** to reload hosts without restarting the application
- **Shows host count** to indicate how many hosts were found
- **Graceful fallback** to "All hosts" mode if inventory parsing fails

#### Inventory File Support
The system parses standard Ansible inventory format including:
- All section types (`[control]`, `[compute]`, `[network]`, etc.)
- Host entries with ansible variables (`host ansible_host=IP ansible_user=user`)
- Automatic filtering of special sections (`:children`, `:vars`)
- Comments and empty line handling
- Error recovery for malformed files

### Host Selection Options
- **All Hosts Mode** (default): Uses all hosts in inventory
- **Individual Selection**: Choose specific hosts for targeted operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected hosts shown as removable pills
- **Dynamic Updates**: Host list updates when inventory file changes

### Hardcoded Inventory
The inventory file path is hardcoded to `/root/xdeploy/nodes` as requested.

### Supported Commands
All standard Kolla Ansible commands are supported:
- bootstrap-servers (default)
- prechecks, deploy, post-deploy
- pull, reconfigure, upgrade, stop
- And others...

### Service Targeting
Commands that support the `-t` flag will show service selection options.
Commands like `bootstrap-servers` automatically disable service selection.

## UI Components

### Progress Section
- **Playbook Progress**: Shows current playbook and status
- **Summary Stats**: Live counters with color coding
- **Tasks List**: Scrollable list of completed tasks with details

### Raw Output
- Collapsible section showing full Ansible output
- Useful for debugging and detailed troubleshooting
- Maintains all original console functionality

## Usage

1. **Select Action**: Choose the Kolla Ansible command to run
2. **Choose Services** (if applicable): Select specific OpenStack services to target
3. **Select Hosts**: Choose specific hosts or use "All hosts"
4. **Run**: Click Run to start the deployment
5. **Monitor**: Watch the structured progress display for real-time updates
6. **Review**: Check the raw output section for detailed logs if needed

## Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: Clear visual feedback on deployment progress
- **Easier Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify failed tasks and their reasons
- **Professional Interface**: Modern, responsive design with meaningful status indicators
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Falls back gracefully to text parsing when needed
- **Complete Information**: Maintains access to full console output when needed
